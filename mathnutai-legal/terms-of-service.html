  <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-12-28</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    MathNut AI is a study companion that helps you understand math using AI-generated explanations,
    scan-based problem solving, flashcards, and quizzes. By downloading or using the app, you agree
    to these Terms of Service (“Terms”). If you do not agree, please do not use MathNut AI.
  </p>

  <h2>Educational Use Only</h2>
  <p>
    MathNut AI is designed for learning and practice. Explanations, solutions, flashcards, and quizzes
    are generated by AI and may sometimes be incomplete or incorrect. You are responsible for checking
    answers and using your own judgment, teachers, or trusted resources to verify results.
  </p>
  <p>
    The app is not intended to replace formal instruction or to be used as a guaranteed source of
    correct answers on tests, exams, or graded assignments.
  </p>

  <h2>Subscriptions & Billing</h2>
  <p>
    MathNut AI offers an optional Premium subscription that may unlock additional features such as
    increased scan attempts, full access to AI flashcards and quizzes, and other advanced tools.
    Subscriptions are billed through your Apple App Store or Google Play account as auto-renewing plans
    unless canceled.
  </p>
  <p>
    Subscription prices, free trial length, and available offers are shown in the app at the time of
    purchase and may vary by region or over time. Payment is charged to your store account at
    confirmation of purchase.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your subscription will automatically renew at the then-current price unless you turn off
    auto-renewal at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your
    subscription at any time in your device’s account settings. Deleting the app does not cancel an
    active subscription.
  </p>

  <h2>Free Tier & Usage Limits</h2>
  <p>
    MathNut AI may offer a free tier with limited daily usage (for example, a limited number of scans
    per day) and access to selected learning tools. We may change these limits, features, or
    availability over time.
  </p>
  <p>
    You agree not to attempt to bypass technical limits, create multiple accounts, or use automated
    tools to access or scrape the service.
  </p>

  <h2>AI-Generated Content</h2>
  <p>
    Solutions, explanations, flashcards, and quizzes are created using third-party AI services. By
    using MathNut AI, you understand and agree that:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>AI output can be incorrect, incomplete, or inappropriate for your specific context.</li>
    <li>
      You will not rely on the app for purposes where inaccurate results could cause harm, including
      professional, financial, medical, or safety-critical decisions.
    </li>
    <li>
      You will not use the app to generate or request illegal, hateful, or abusive content.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    MathNut AI is provided <strong>“AS IS”</strong> and <strong>“AS AVAILABLE”</strong>, without
    warranties of any kind, to the fullest extent permitted by law.
  </p>

  <h2>Free Trial</h2>
  <p>
    If a free trial is offered, it will convert into a paid subscription at the end of the trial
    period unless you cancel at least 24 hours before the trial ends. Any unused portion of a free
    trial may be forfeited when you purchase a subscription.
  </p>
  <p>
    The exact trial length and pricing are displayed in the app at the time of purchase.
  </p>

  <h2>Usage Rules</h2>
  <p>
    You agree not to misuse MathNut AI, including attempting to reverse engineer, disrupt, or overload
    the service; using it for unlawful purposes; infringing on the rights of others; or violating the
    terms of the app stores or any third-party services we rely on.
  </p>
  <p>
    We reserve the right to suspend or terminate access if we reasonably believe your use violates
    these rules or harms other users or the service.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes & Termination</h2>
  <p>
    We may update MathNut AI, change features, or modify these Terms from time to time. When we make
    material changes, we may update the in-app text or store listing.
  </p>
  <p>
    Your continued use of the app after changes are made constitutes acceptance of the revised Terms.
    You may stop using the app at any time and cancel subscriptions through your store account
    settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Severability</h2>
  <p>
    If any part of these Terms is found to be invalid or unenforceable, the remaining provisions will
    remain in full force and effect to the extent permitted by law.
  </p>
