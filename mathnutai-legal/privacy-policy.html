  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> 2025-01-01</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Your privacy is important to us. This Privacy Policy explains what information MathNut AI
    processes and how it is used in order to provide AI-powered math explanations, flashcards,
    quizzes, and related features.
  </p>

  <h2>Data We Process in the App</h2>
  <p>
    MathNut AI is primarily designed to run on your device. The app may store the following
    information locally on your phone or tablet:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      App preferences such as theme, language, and appearance settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Learning-related state such as onboarding progress, subscription status flags, and a
      lightweight history of problems you scanned or solved.
    </li>
    <li>
      Daily usage counters (for example, how many scans you have performed today) to enforce
      free-tier limits.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect your name, email address,
    or other direct personal identifiers from within the app.
  </p>

  <h2>Images, Math Problems, and AI Services</h2>
  <p>
    When you scan a math problem or use AI-powered features (such as flashcards or quizzes),
    the app may send relevant content (for example, an image of the problem or a text prompt)
    to third-party AI providers in order to generate solutions, explanations, or learning
    materials.
  </p>
  <p>
    These providers process the content solely to generate responses back to the app. We do
    not use this content to build advertising profiles. AI providers may temporarily process
    or log requests to operate and secure their services. Their handling of data is governed
    by their own privacy policies, which you should review.
  </p>
  <p>
    Please avoid including personal, sensitive, or confidential information in images or text
    submitted through the app (such as faces, full names, addresses, or identification numbers).
  </p>

  <h2>Purchases and Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>
    Purchases and subscriptions for MathNut AI are processed by Apple or Google, not directly
    by us. We do not receive your full payment details, such as credit card numbers. Billing
    and payment information is handled under the App Store or Google Play privacy policies
    and terms.
  </p>

  <h2>Diagnostics and Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    To help improve app stability and understand feature usage, we may collect basic,
    anonymized diagnostics or analytics data (such as crash reports, screen visits, or
    generic device information). This data is used only to improve the app and does not
    aim to personally identify you.
  </p>

  <h2>Your Choices & Data Control</h2>
  <p>You can:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Manage or cancel subscriptions through your App Store or Google Play account settings.
    </li>
    <li>
      Disable certain system-level analytics or ad-tracking options in your device settings,
      depending on your platform.
    </li>
    <li>
      Delete the app at any time, which removes locally stored data such as preferences and
      learning history from your device.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    If you have privacy questions, you can contact the developer using the contact details
    provided in the app store listing.
  </p>

  <h2>Children & Educational Use</h2>
  <p>
    MathNut AI is intended as a study aid and may be used by students with appropriate
    supervision. We do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from
    children. If you believe a child has provided personal information through the app,
    please contact us via the app store listing so we can address your request.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time to reflect changes in the app,
    AI providers, or legal requirements. When we do, we will update the “Last updated”
    date above. Your continued use of the app after changes are made means you accept
    the revised policy.
